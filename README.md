Tents and trees puzzle solver implemented in Elixir and Prolog.

The rules of Tents and trees:
- Pair each tree with a tent adjacent horizontally or vertically. This should be a 1 to 1 relation.
- Tents never touch each other even diagonally
- The clues outside the grid indicate the number of tents on that row/column.
